    <p>Here is a paragraph of something I wrote before.</p>
    <p>
      Oh, I fantasized again, fantasizing that I fell in love with the maid next
      door who wore glasses and had black hair, but he didn't agree with us
      being together.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I was not convinced and went to argue with him,</li>
      <li>
        and he said that we should hold a left-right slapping competition to
        decide the winner.
      </li>
      <li>
        I said okay, but he slapped me twice on the left and right when I
        brought my laptop that day.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I was so angry that I picked up the computer and beat him up. The footage
      was recorded by the maid and made into a kick.
